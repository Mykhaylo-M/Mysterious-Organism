## Project Goals

- Context: Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, _Pila aequor (P. aequor)_, and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make _P. aequor_ an interesting specimen to study. However, _P. aequor_ cannot survive above sea level and locating _P. aequor_ in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of _P. aequor_ for your research team to study.
